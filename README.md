tkngen-api. A RESTFUL API to deploy ERC20 / BEP20 tokens.

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sntsabode/tkngen-api
cd tkngen-api
```

```sh
yarn install
```

## Usage

```sh
yarn run start:build
```

## Run tests

***(Linux)***
```sh
yarn run test
```

If you're on windows it's likely this command will fail.
However it is only a shorthand to running the `./.tesh.sh` bash script.

***(Windows (assuming git is installed [or bash files are runnable]))***

```sh
./.test.sh
```
